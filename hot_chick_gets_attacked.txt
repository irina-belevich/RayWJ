What's happening forum?
Whe world are a lot of good viral video out of this past week.
So i decided to review this classic involving little hamster.
Look at him go his, that little guy is running pretty down fast on the wheel.
well, sleeps
I know that's all but on my opinion that's probably the best viral video of all time.
Moving furniture sacks
especially we have to move it downstairs
when you see these guys then you just say * through your the window
it's funny because you hear the guy on the ground telling him make sure push it out the way they cracked the air condition
oh damn
by the way get the things done i'm pretty sure these guys work for viral government
it's fine i know at least the cracked the air conditioner
well
forum i'm not really in to prank video
but this one from last week is all of internet
check it out
see to me this video seems fake whe 
but sum that it is real why is this guy ever fake billy head anyway? 
and honestly, i don't blame this girl for being scared
i'd be scared too if i woke up and just
and hy he tries to scare her anyway
get this guy think of better things to do with her in bed like pillow fight?
